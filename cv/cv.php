                        <h4>Australian School of Business</h4>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Project type:</dt><dd>Website</dd>
                            <dt>Client:</dt><dd>University of New South Wales</dd>
                            <dt>Agency:</dt><dd>Intergen</dd>
                            <dt>URL:</dt><dd>N/A<sup>*</sup></dd>
                        </dl>
                        <p>When Intergen called and asked if I’d be interested in heading a small team of front end developers to build a new responsive website for the UNSW’s Business School I jumped at the chance. I was looking forward to both working alongside the Intergen crew and to the challenges of building a large scale site.</p>
                        <p>Some of the curlier aspects of the build were brought about by the technological constraints of Sharepoint and Internet Explorer 8. Because the code base is to be maintained by the client, we aimed to employ object-oriented CSS as a means of delivering readable and compact code. And the (near) end result is an engaging, mobile-first experience that the school is very excited about.</p>
                        <p><sup>*</sup><i>At the time of writing this project is in progress. Go live is August, 2014.</i></p>
                        <h4>Showtools</h4>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Project type:</dt><dd>Website</dd>
                            <dt>Client:</dt><dd>Flying Fish Productions</dd>
                            <dt>Agency:</dt><dd>Springload</dd>
                            <dt>URL:</dt><dd><a href="https://www.showtools.com/">showtools.com</a></dd>
                        </dl>
                        <p>Showtools provide a suite of online tools for the film and television industry, facilitating the booking of crew and rental equipment, as well as production planning for shoots. I’d performed a lot of work on the booking tools in the application itself, now the whole suite required a public web face to allow the client to market the services.</p>
                        <p>For their new site I took a mobile first approach implementing the best in object-oriented CSS with SASS to keep the code base clean. The site features a custom drawn set of vector glyphs, CSS animations and a delightful responsiveness across devices.</p>
                        <h4>Typesetter</h4>
                        <dl>
                            <dt>Project type:</dt><dd>Web app</dd>

                        </dl>
                        <p>This app was born from my desire to preview and test fonts—particularly on iOS—without the faff of fiddling about with stylesheets. Typesetter provides a quick and simple way to prototype your installed fonts, with in-the-browser control over font-family, point size, spacing, leading, kerning, colour and more.</p>
                        <h4>Mastermind</h4>
                        <dl>

                        </dl>
                        <p>Mastermind is an old favourite of mine and to turn it into a striking app that I could enjoy and share was a small, but rewarding, labour of love.</p>
