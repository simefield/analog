            </dl>
            <p>Alphero are a fast-growing design-led digital development company offering end-to-end solutions for Android, iOS and web.</p>
            <p>As a member of the web team, I led the front-end build on a number of projects including: The Co-operative Bank, MyMSD, Paymark, MFAT and FMG.</p>
            <p>After a couple of years at Alphero working with a mix of my favourite CSS frameworks I decided to put my hand to formalising an in-house boilerplate. Out of my jumble of experience, development, and borrowed code I wrote what was to become Alphero‘s standard SASS framework, AINT (Alphero’s Inverted Triangle). AINT gives our web developers a running start on our projects and has proven quick and lean, with our average CSS files weighing in at anywhere from 5,000-7,500 lines of code. It has been used on every web project since early 2016, and it continues to be refined and improved upon.</p>

            <dl>
              <dt>Role:</dt><dd>Daddy day care & part-time designer / developer</dd>
            </dl>
            <p>I took 18 months off from full-time employment to care for my 3-year old son. This also allowed my wife to take a break of her own and get back to primary school teaching.</p>
             <h4>Australian School of Business</h4>
            <dl>
              <dt>Project type:</dt><dd>Website</dd>
              <dt>Client:</dt><dd>University of New South Wales</dd>
              <dt>Agency:</dt><dd>Intergen</dd>
              <dt>URL:</dt><dd><a href="https://www.business.unsw.edu.au/">business.unsw.edu.au</a></dd>
            </dl>
            <p>When Intergen called and asked if I’d be interested in heading a small team of front end developers to build a new responsive website for the UNSW’s Business School I jumped at the chance. I was looking forward to both working alongside the Intergen crew and to the challenges of building a large scale site.</p>
            <p>Some of the curlier aspects of the build were brought about by the technological constraints of Sharepoint and Internet Explorer 8. Because the code base is to be maintained by the client, we aimed to employ object-oriented CSS as a means of delivering readable and compact code. And the (near) end result is an engaging, mobile-first experience that the school is very excited about.</p>
            <h4>Showtools</h4>
            <dl>
              <dt>Project type:</dt><dd>Website</dd>

              <dt>URL:</dt><dd><a href="https://www.showtools.com/">showtools.com</a></dd>
            </dl>
            <p>Showtools provide a suite of online tools for the film and television industry, facilitating the booking of crew and rental equipment, as well as production planning for shoots. I’d performed a lot of work on the booking tools in the application itself, now the whole suite required a public web face to allow the client to market the services.</p>
            <p>For their new site I took a mobile first approach implementing the best in object-oriented CSS with SASS to keep the code base clean. The site features a custom drawn set of vector glyphs, CSS animations and a delightful responsiveness across devices.</p>

            </dl>
            <p>This app was born from my desire to preview and test fonts—particularly on iOS—without the faff of fiddling about with stylesheets. Typesetter provides a quick and simple way to prototype your installed fonts, with in-the-browser control over font-family, point size, spacing, leading, kerning, colour and more.</p>
            <h4>Mastermind</h4>
            <dl>
              <dt>Project type:</dt><dd>Web app</dd>

            </dl>
            <p>Mastermind is an old favourite of mine and to turn it into a striking app that I could enjoy and share was a small, but rewarding, labour of love.</p>

            <p>Springload values their clients and staff highly, while also placing an emphasis on top calibre code. And so do I. This made for an enjoyable and creative tenure that enabled me to hone my front end skills on some wondrously designed projects, including websites for: Kiwibank, Wellington Airport, NZ International Arts Festival, CreativeNZ, Chamber Music,&nbsp;&c.</p>
            <p>My time with Springload was invaluable in my path to becoming a fully-fledged object-oriented CSS developer.</p>
