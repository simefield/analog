        <h1>This Gun for Hire</h1>
        <p>Howdy. This is my equine friend Stella and I’m Richard Sime, a freelance front end web developer. I've been wrangling websites for more than ten years now. In fact you’re probably familiar with some of my handiwork.</p>
        <p>Having worked with some of Wellington’s top design agencies, I have lead the front end build on sites including: Kiwibank, Wellington Airport, NZ International Arts Festival, CreativeNZ, the Australian School of Business and numerous other high profile clients. <a href="/projects/">Mosey on over to my projects</a>.</p>
        <p>If you’re a design agency or development company that needs more hands on deck during busy times, I can help.</p>
        <p>Or if you’re after a new website, or mayhaps your current site is getting a little long in the tooth and you’d like it to work across devices and platforms, we can discuss your options.</p>
        <?php /*
        <p>If you’d like to know more about my training and experience <a href="/cv/">take a goo at my cv</a>.</p>
        <p>My skillset includes CSS (OO SASS), HTML, JavaScript, RWD, Adobe CS, &c. And I have access to a number of Wellington’s top designers and developers.</p>
