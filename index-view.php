        <h1>This Gun for Hire</h1>
        <p>Howdy. This is my equine friend Stella and I’m Richard Sime, a freelance front end web developer. I've been wrangling websites for more than ten years now. In fact you’re probably familiar with some of my handiwork.</p>
        <p>Having worked for some of Wellington’s top design agencies, I have helped build sites for Kiwibank, Wellington Airport, NZ International Arts Festival, CreativeNZ, Chamber Music, the University of New South Wales and a number of other high profile clients. Feel free to <a href="http://richardsime.com/">mosey on over to my portfolio.</a></p>
        <p>If you’re a design agency or development company that needs more hands on deck during busy times, I can help.</p>
        <p>Or if you’re after a new website, or you have an existing site but’s it’s getting a little long in the tooth and you’d like it to work on mobile, we can discuss your options.</p>
        <p>My skillset includes CSS (OO SASS), HTML, JavaScript, RWD, Adobe CS, &c. And I have access to a number of Wellington’s top designers and developers.</p>
