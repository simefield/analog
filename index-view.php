     <p class="lead">I remember the day a friend first told me of something called a “stylesheet”. It sounds silly now, but I was gob-smacked to learn I could change the colour of <i>all</i> the links on a website by defining it in just one place.</p>
     <p>Both myself and CSS have come a long way since then. I've come to cherish the challenges of responsive layouts, and of writing readable, succinct and maintainable code, while this beastly lanuage has been domesticated by CSS pre-processing.</p>
     <p>My background was in the more artistic realm of digital multimedia (3D modelling, animation, &c.). I then went on to work in print and digital design, and desktop publishing. It was around the same time I practised web design and development in earnest.</p>
     <p>My appetite for beautiful web design and typography was largely satisfied during my tenure at Springload, though it also spoiled me in the same way teaching your enemies about bad ke<span style="letter-spacing: -.05em;">r</span>n<span style="letter-spacing: .1em;">i</span>ng can do.</p>
     <p>During this period, my inner OOCSS (Object Oriented CSS) self was awakened through the musings of the rockstars of front-end development such as Doug Bowman, Stubbornella, Ethan Marcotte, Paul Irish and Harry Roberts, to name but a few.</p>
     <p>More recently, while working at Alphero, I have developed AINT – a lean SASS framework designed for rapid development, lightweight stylesheets, and robust and maintainable code. It incorporates BEM-esque naming (we call it “Better-than-BEM”) and has been influenced by frameworks such as INUITCSS, ITCSS, and SUITCSS.</p>
     <h3>Hire me</h3>
     <p>I’m available for short-term contracts to build websites, or I’m available for hire as a consultant to assess your current methods or to help teach your staff how to write lean CSS.</p>

    <!-- <h1>This Gun for Hire</h1>
    <p>Howdy. This is my equine friend Stella and I’m Richard Sime, a freelance front end web developer. I've been wrangling websites for more than ten years now. In fact you’re probably familiar with some of my handiwork.</p>
    <p>Having worked with some of Wellington’s top design agencies, I have lead the front end build on sites including: Kiwibank, Wellington Airport, NZ International Arts Festival, CreativeNZ, the Australian School of Business and numerous other high profile clients. <a href="projects/">Mosey on over to my projects</a>.</p>
    <p>If you’re a design agency or development company that needs more hands on deck during busy times, I can help.</p>
    <p>Or if you’re after a new website, or mayhaps your current site is getting a little long in the tooth and you’d like it to work across devices and platforms, we can discuss your options.</p> -->
    <?php /*
    <p>If you’d like to know more about my training and experience <a href="cv/">take a goo at my cv</a>.</p>
    <p>My skillset includes CSS (OO SASS), HTML, JavaScript, RWD, Adobe CS, &c. And I have access to a number of Wellington’s top designers and developers.</p>
