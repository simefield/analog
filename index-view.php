    <p class="lead">A glass monkey polishes the screen, that is, they write the HTML and CSS required to make a website or app faithfully reflect design,
    respond seemlessly to variations in viewport dimensions, and uphold consistency and harmony throughout.</p>
    <p>It is commmon for a project’s CSS to get a bit unruly. To achieve success a well-structured and clearly defined codebase is needed.</p>
    <p>I advocate for a well thought-out and unopinionated CSS pre-processing framework combined with BEM methodologies.
      Having written just such a boilerplate while at Alphero, I am now developing a lighter and more flexible one.</p>
    <p>So, why not grab yourself a hot covfefe and settle in to peruse my <a href="projects/">portfolio</a> and <a href="cv/">curriculum vitæ</a>.</p>
    <h2>Hire me</h2>
    <p>I’m available for short-term contracts to either build new websites or transition existing projects into a more manageable state, or as a consultant to assess your current methods and to teach your staff to write slim CSS.</p>
