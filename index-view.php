     <h1>About what I&nbsp;do</h1>
     <p>I remember the day a friend first told me of something called a “stylesheet”. It sounds silly now, but I was gob-smacked to learn I could change the colour of <i>all</i> the links on a website by defining it in just one place.</p>
     <p>Since then, both CSS and myself have come a long way. This once beastly lanuage has been domesticated, and I've come to cherish the challenges of responsive layouts, and of writing readable, succinct and maintainable code.</p>
     <p>My background was in the more artistic realm of digital multimedia (3D modelling, animation, &c.). I then went on to work in print and digital design, and desktop publishing. It was around the same time I practised web design and development in earnest.</p>
     <p>My appetite for beautiful web design and typography was largely satisfied during my tenure at Springload, though it also spoiled me in the same way teaching your enemies about bad ke<span style="letter-spacing: -.05em;">r</span>n<span style="letter-spacing: .1em;">i</span>ng can do.</p>
     <p>During this period, my inner OOCSS (object-oriented CSS) self was awakened through the musings of the rockstars of front-end development such as Paul Irish, Doug Bowman, Ethan Marcotte and Harry Roberts, to name but a few.</p>
     <p>More recently, while working at Alphero, I have developed AINT – a lean SASS framework designed for rapid development, lightweight stylesheets, and robust and maintainable code. It incorporates BEM-esque naming (we call it “Better-than-BEM”) and has been influenced by frameworks such as INUITCSS, ITCSS, and SUITCSS.</p>

    <!-- <h1>This Gun for Hire</h1>
    <p>Howdy. This is my equine friend Stella and I’m Richard Sime, a freelance front end web developer. I've been wrangling websites for more than ten years now. In fact you’re probably familiar with some of my handiwork.</p>
    <p>Having worked with some of Wellington’s top design agencies, I have lead the front end build on sites including: Kiwibank, Wellington Airport, NZ International Arts Festival, CreativeNZ, the Australian School of Business and numerous other high profile clients. <a href="projects/">Mosey on over to my projects</a>.</p>
    <p>If you’re a design agency or development company that needs more hands on deck during busy times, I can help.</p>
    <p>Or if you’re after a new website, or mayhaps your current site is getting a little long in the tooth and you’d like it to work across devices and platforms, we can discuss your options.</p> -->
    <?php /*
    <p>If you’d like to know more about my training and experience <a href="cv/">take a goo at my cv</a>.</p>
    <p>My skillset includes CSS (OO SASS), HTML, JavaScript, RWD, Adobe CS, &c. And I have access to a number of Wellington’s top designers and developers.</p>
